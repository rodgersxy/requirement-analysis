## What is Requirement Analysis?  

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional   requirements of a software system. It plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by    ensuring that developers and stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the system must achieve. This phase    helps define the project scope, prevents misunderstandings, and minimizes costly changes during    development, ultimately leading to the creation of a product that meets user needs and expectations.
